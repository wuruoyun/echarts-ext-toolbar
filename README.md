# ECharts with External Toolbar

> Example showing a custom toolbar outside the chart built with ECharts.

## Features

The first three buttons in the toolbar allow user to switch between three exclusive interaction modes:

* `Nagivate`: Scroll mouse wheel to zoom in/out and click-drag to pan (if you already zoomed in)
* `Select`: Select lines with a brush box
* `Zoom`: Zoom into a region with a brush box

The other buttons in the toolbar triggers one-time action:

* `Zoom reset`: Reset the zoom rate to view all data
* `Download image`: Download the chart to an image file
* `Other config`: A placeholder to add other custom configuration, like change axis to log scale, change color options, etc.
